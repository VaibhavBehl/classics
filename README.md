classics
--------

these are my veryyyy old projects which i did when i first encountered Java(please don't judge me by these!!).. 
Most of the work i do these days cant be put online.

All these projects are based on Java UI technologies-swings/Applet->useless these days :( , 
putting these on GITHUB as they might help some kid with some classroom assignment.
